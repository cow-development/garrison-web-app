        <h1>Greetings, {{ user.username }} !</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Reginald. I've developed this game because I love Warcraft and I am too dumb to build
          some great 3D game. I hate vectors and they hate me. Anyway, I've worked like a lot to deliver you guys this
          product I'll try to continuously improve. You obviously got the right not to like it, and your opinion means a
          lot to me so please feel free to give me some feedback. User experience, user interface, gameplay mechanisms,
          you name it. Please enjoy your adventure here ! üëç

            You've been summoned by high authority to establish a garrison in the Eastern Kingdoms. But first we need to
            know who you are and who you're fighting for.
